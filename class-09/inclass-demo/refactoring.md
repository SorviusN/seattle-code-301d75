# Things that are Not Great in Code

## Absolutely Necessary

- errors
- bugs

## Definitely A Good Idea
 > our focus on refactoring & modularization

- improper indentation
- really long files
- unclear variable names
- lack of comments
- repetition/not DRY
- multifunctional functions
- inconsistency in types of functions used
  - inconsistency in how we declare variables (let/const vs var)
- poor organization

## Nice To Have

- unused variables/imports
- abandoned/dead code
- too much whitespace
- too little whitespace
- swear words

### refactoring: making our code better without changing its functionality from a user's perspective
